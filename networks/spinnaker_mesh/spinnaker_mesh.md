SpiNNaker Mesh Network Subsection
=================================

An illustration of a subsection of the hexagonal torus network used in
[SpiNNaker](http://apt.cs.man.ac.uk/projects/SpiNNaker/). This version is drawn
with all edges of equal distance rather than the misleading projection often
used with a normal 2D mesh augmented with diagonal links.

[Download `spinnaker-mesh.tex`](file://src/spinnaker-mesh.tex)

Usage
-----

	::latex
	\input{spinnaker-mesh}

\begin{latex}[--pdf SpiNNaker Mesh]
	\input{src/spinnaker-mesh}
\end{latex}

Can be varied in size by adjusting the clip and for loop dimensions. Sorry this
isn't done with a nice variable...
