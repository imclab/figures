SpiNNaker Board Connectivity
============================

[Download `boards.py`](file://src/boards.py)

Shows the long wires in a network of $4\times4$ threeboards in
[SpiNNaker](http://apt.cs.man.ac.uk/projects/SpiNNaker/). Red, Green and Blue
correspond to North, North-East, East respectively. Touching edges are
implicitly connected.

Uses the [SpiNNer](https://github.com/mossblaser/SpiNNer) library which must be
present in `/home/jonathan/Programing/Python/SpiNNer`. (Sorry...)
