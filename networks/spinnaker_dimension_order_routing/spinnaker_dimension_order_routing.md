SpiNNaker Dimension Order Routing
=================================

[Download `dimension-order-routing.tex`](file://src/dimension-order-routing.tex)

An illustration of dimension order routing between two points in the
[SpiNNaker](http://apt.cs.man.ac.uk/projects/SpiNNaker/) network including a set
of unit vectors. This version is drawn with all edges of equal distance rather
than the misleading projection often used with a normal 2D mesh augmented with
diagonal links.

Usage
-----

	::latex
	\input{dimension-order-routing}

\begin{latex}[--pdf Dimension Order Routing]
	\input{src/dimension-order-routing}
\end{latex}

Can be varied in size by adjusting the clip and for loop dimensions. Sorry this
isn't done with a nice variable...
